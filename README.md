# B-Sider: A Song Recommendation Web Application
B-Sider is a song recommendation web application using the Flask framework focusing on less-popular songs. The user enters in a name of a musical artist, and a list is generated of their top 10 most popular songs on Spotify. The user checks what songs they like, and by analyzing the acoustic, dance, energy, speechiness, instrumentalness, valence, and live values of their favorite songs, a list is generated of less-popular songs by the same artist with similiar values.
