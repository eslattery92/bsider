# B-Sider: A Song Recommedation Web Application
B-Sider is a song recommedation web application using the Flask framework focusing on less-popular songs. The user enters in a name of a musical artist, and a list is generated of their top 10 most popular songs on Spotify. The user checks what songs they like, and by analyzing the acoustic, dance, energy, speechiness, instrumentalness, valence, and live values of their favorite songs, compared with those values with the 50 least popular songs by the artist (or their bottom 50% of songs if they have less than 50 songs total) to see which songs have the closest match.
